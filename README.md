# Yelp Dataset Analysis: PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB

## Overview

This project focuses on designing, implementing, and analyzing data systems using the [Yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). The key objectives include creating a relational schema for the dataset, visualized through an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, and loading the data into both a relational database (PostgreSQL) and a non-relational database (MongoDB). We evaluated the two systems through a benchmark set of five representative queries to compare their fitness and performance. These queries analyzed the databases' usability, storage efficiency, memory usage, and query execution times. The findings, presented in a comprehensive report with diagrams, code snippets, and visualizations, provide actionable insights into the trade-offs between the two data systems, offering recommendations for selecting the optimal database for specific tasks.

## Key Deliverables
1. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the dataset schema.
2. Fully loaded Yelp dataset in PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
3. Benchmark results comparing database systems across usability and performance.
4. Detailed report with insights, visualizations, and recommendations.
