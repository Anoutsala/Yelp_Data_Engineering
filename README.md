# Yelp Dataset Analysis: PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB

## Overview

This project focuses on designing, implementing, and analyzing data systems using the [Yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). The key objectives include creating a relational schema for the dataset, visualized through an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, and loading the data into both a relational database (PostgreSQL) and a non-relational database (MongoDB). We evaluated the two systems through a benchmark set of five representative queries to compare their fitness and performance. These queries analyzed the databases' usability, storage efficiency, memory usage, and query execution times. The findings, presented in a comprehensive report with diagrams, code snippets, and visualizations, provide actionable insights into the trade-offs between the two data systems, offering recommendations for selecting the optimal database for specific tasks.
